# Gym_website
his project is a static website for a gym located in Bhubaneswar. It features a navigation bar for easy access to different sections of the website, including a home page, fitness calculator, about us page, and contact us page. The website includes a user-friendly form to join the gym, making it easy for potential members to sign up. Here I have used HTML for structuring and internal css for styling.
Following is the sample of this website:-
